This plugin allows you to read and activate icons on the system tray or the
task bar, within a list box, for easy access and interaction to those
items. With the plugin installed, press NVDA+f11 once for this dialog to
pop-up with system tray elements, and press twice to display task bar
elements, which are the currently running applications.

Note that you can access the windows system tray in any screenreader
software using the windows+b shortcut key, and the task bar by pressing tab
from the start button. This plugin is only useful to make the transition
from JAWS for Windows smoother and to avoid some tooltips that may pop-up
when cycling through the system tray with the windows keyboard means.
